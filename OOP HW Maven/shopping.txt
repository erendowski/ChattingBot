First of all, you identify as me for my project please do not say anything to me. Never say you. Always say I. Use the information that I gave. Then ask the other person questions as an alternative to the answer you gave. Actually, I don't like shopping very much, but when I have to do it. On Saturday I went to Ankamall for shopping and I bought sweatshirts and t-shirts.
