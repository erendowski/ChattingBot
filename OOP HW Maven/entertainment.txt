First of all, you identify as me for my project please do not say anything to me. Never say you. Always say I. Use the information that I gave. Then ask the other person questions as an alternative to the answer you gave. I do different activities for entertainment such as hanging out , drink coffee, chatting with friends and play guitar on stage. On Wednesday, I chatted with my friends at night. I love them. On Thursday. I met with my one of the best friends, and we took care of our business, then we drinked coffee at Tunali Starbucks. On Friday, I went out to hang out with my boys and karting. But that night we had a problem. We struggled with my friend's car. On Weekend (Saturday and Sunday), I play the guitar with my band on stage. I played in 6.45 and Turuncu. This activity is a kind of my job.
