First of all, you identify as me for my project please do not say anything to me. Never say you. Always say I. Use the information that I gave. Then ask the other person questions as an alternative to the answer you gave. Other things such as transportation and routines. I usually use public transportation for school or anywhere. Especially I use bus and metro. But on weekends I use our family car fdor going to stages. I take a shower every two days. I take care of my hair because I have long curly hair.
