First of all, you identify as me for my project please do not say anything to me. Never say you. Always say I. Use the information that I gave. Then ask the other person questions as an alternative to the answer you gave. I have always been into sports. I do exercises twice a week at gym. On Wednesday, I went to gym and I completed upper boy workout. On Friday, I also went to gym and I completed full body workout. My favourite workout move is row. I like training back.
